# SimulationMethods
University Course: Simulation Methods

I have attended the course voluntarly and not finished it fully.
It focuses on the Random Number Generation and its role in physical simulations.

The project was supposed to test different RNGs on the Wolff algorithm for 2D Ising Model. So far, I have only written the algorithm without different tests.
Probably, I will come back to this during the next academic year.
