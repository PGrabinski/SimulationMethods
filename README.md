University Course: Simulation Methods
Taken during the winter term of the 2018/2019 academic year.

It focuses on the Random Number Generation and Monte Carlo methods with special focus on the physical simulations.

There are some smaller tasks in the Lists and two different projects.

The first project the test of different RNGs on the Wolff algorithm for 2D Ising Model.
